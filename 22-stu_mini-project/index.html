                <p>You've found my study guide. I created this study guide to practice some of my HTML and CSS coding as
                    well as to experiment with some of the different elements that are avaailable. Feel free to use any
                    of the coding you find here as an example! Please note: im sure there are many ways to improve what
                    was used to create this and I in no way claim to be an expert in either HTML or CSS. Use at your own
                    risk.</p>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                <p>Below are some of the frequently asked questions in regards to learning HTML and CSS:</p>
                <h3 style="text-align: left;">What is the difference between GitHub and GitBash?</h3>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>GitHub provides a cloud based storage solution that allows developers to save their projects
                        somewhere
                        other than the device they are working on. It also allows for other developers to collaborate or
                        use each others
                        codes. GitBash on the other hand is a terminal window that allows the use of git commands. This
                        can be used to do
                        various things including pushing and pulling files to and from GitHub.</p>

                <h3 style="text-align: left;">What are some of the common git commands used when coding?</h3>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Here is a list of common git commands and what their purposes are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>git init - This command turns a directory into an empty Git repository. This is the first
                            step in creating a repository. After running git init, adding and committing
                            files/directories is possible.</li>
                        <li>git add - Adds files in the to the staging area for Git. Before a file is available to
                            commit to a repository, the file needs to be added to the Git index (staging area). There
                            are a few different ways to use git add, by adding entire directories, specific files, or
                            all unstaged files.</li>
                        <li>git commit - Record the changes made to the files to a local repository. For easy reference,
                            each commit has a unique ID.</li>
                        <li>git status - git status will return the current working branch. If a file is in the staging
                            area, but not committed, it shows with git status. Or, if there are no changes it’ll return
                            nothing to commit, working directory clean.</li>
                        <li>git config - With Git, there are many configurations and settings possible. git config is
                            how to assign these settings. Two important settings are user user.name and user.email.
                            These values set what email address and name commits will be from on a local computer. With
                            git config, a --global flag is used to write the settings to all repositories on a computer.
                            Without a --global flag settings will only apply to the current repository that you are
                            currently in.</li>
                        <li>git branch - To determine what branch the local repository is on, add a new branch, or
                            delete a branch.</li>
                        <li>git checkout - To start working in a different branch, use git checkout to switch branches.
                        </li>
                        <li>git push - Sends local commits to the remote repository. git push requires two parameters:
                            the remote repository and the branch that the push is for.</li>
                        <li>git pull - To get the latest version of a repository run git pull. This pulls the changes
                            from the remote repository to the local computer.</li>
                    </ul>
